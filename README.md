## Notes from UDEMY class

## Regions and services

First off, you need an aws account, you can start one for free and have a 6-month trial and 200 usd in credits.

You have a ton of services available at AWS, but not all services are available on all regions. Make sure that the services you use exist for your region. If you need a service unavailable for your region, select a different region and be done with it.

## Responsibilities

The customer has some responsibilities and AWS has some others. Some of these responsibilities overlap.

The customer is responsible for:

- customer data
- platform, applications, identity and access management
- OS, network and firewall configuration
- client data encryption and data integrity authentication
- server side encryption (file system or data)
- networking traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)
